# Beat Blocks

A simple step sequencer (and a few other experiments) using React and [Tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io). Our MVP started as a simple four-track sequencer where users can select from a few included samples and basically paint in along the timeline where you want that sample to play. It has evolved to include a Lego aesthetic and a few other fun interactive elements showcasing what we learned along the way.

### Other features:
- Interactive synth using your mouse to generate tones
- Beat Pixel demo generating sounds and randomising colors within a grid of pixels.
- Laser lightshow
